      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p> Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand
        your product vision.<br>
        The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br>
        Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need. </p>
